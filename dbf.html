			<p><strong>What: </strong>Contributing to the Design Build Fly (DBF) competition team at UCLA, focused on
				designing,
				testing, and building a remote-controlled aircraft for AIAA’s annual collegiate competition.<br />

				<br /><strong>Why:
				</strong>To gain hands-on experience in iterative aircraft design and fabrication, collaborate across
				engineering
				disciplines (aerodynamics, structures, controls, propulsion), and strengthen both technical and communication
				skills in a fast-paced, team-oriented environment.

				<br /><br /><strong>How: </strong>In the 2024–25 season, I was a member of the Aerodynamics and Manufacturing
				subteams.
			<ul>
				<li>In Aerodynamics, I contributed to CFD simulations, stability analyses, and post-flight data processing using
					tools
					such as SimScale, XFLR5, MATLAB, and some ANSYS Fluent and C++.</li>
				<li>On the Manufacturing side, I helped construct key components of the competition aircraft, including
					performing carbon
					fiber layups for the fuselage, laser cutting wooden ribs, and applying Monokote to the wing and tail.</li>
			</ul>
			<br />For the 2025–26 season, I now serve as Vice Project Manager (VPM). In this role, I support the Project
			Manager
			with administrative responsibilities such as budgeting, recruitment, and competition logistics, while also
			coordinating
			closely with the Chief Engineer. This position serves as training for the Project Manager role in the 2026–27
			season.
			I also plan to join the CAD and Propulsion subteams to further broaden my engineering
			skillset.
			<br /><br /><strong>Results
				(so far): </strong>Our team achieved a historic performance--2nd place in the Design Report and 10th overall at
			the
			AIAA DBF competition, the best results in team history. We’re excited to build on that momentum in the upcoming
			season!</p>
