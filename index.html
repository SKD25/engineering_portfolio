      <h2>About Me!</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Sohan, an aerospace engineering student at UCLA with a deep curiosity about flight and how we can push its boundaries. I'm especially drawn to aerodynamics and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), where physics, design, and problem-solving come together to shape the future of aviation.</p>
      <p>I'm currently the Vice Project Manager of UCLA’s Design Build Fly team, where I help lead the design, testing, and manufacturing of competition aircraft. I work across sub-teams to make sure our designs are optimized, our timelines stay on track, and our plane is ready to perform. Whether it's coordinating drag-reduction trade studies or supporting a wind tunnel test, I love being hands-on with every part of the process.</p>
      <p>In research, I previously worked at the I²BL lab at UCLA, focusing on microfluidic devices and surface coatings. That experience taught me how to approach experimental work and analyze results in a structured, detail-oriented way. This summer, I’ll be continuing to grow as a researcher as an incoming Visiting Scholar at the WindFLuX Lab at UT Dallas, where I’ll be further working on wind tunnel testing and data analysis for boundary layers across waves!</p>
